  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>Grant Richard Kwiecinski, also known by his stage name GRiZ, is an American DJ, songwriter, and electronic music producer from Southfield Michigan. 
    Kwiecinski was born and raised in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. 
    His cousin Wyatt Willard lived with him until he was 10 years old. In elementary school, Kwiecinski was first introduced to the alto sax as well as the piano. 
    After growing up on big horn sounds of funk groups like The Meters, Kwiecinski found himself gravitating towards that influence when he first began making his own music in college. </br>
  </br>He attended Birmingham Groves High School and then Michigan State University for several years before he dropped out to focus on a music career.
    It was also during his college years that he had become personally comfortable enough to openly identify as gay.
    While at Michigan State he would frequently DJ parties at his friends' fraternity houses and play shows in the East Lansing area. GRiZ first became popular with the release of his free debut album, 
    End of the World Party, in 2011. With the release, he ended up supporting bigger artists such as Bassnectar, Pretty Lights, Gramatik, and Big Gigantic on their respective tours, eventually leading to his own headlining tour.</p>
